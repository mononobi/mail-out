Email Subject From {sender_name} Goes Here

Email message to {target_name} goes here.

Message body could have as many lines as you want with empty lines in between.

- The first line of this file would be used to detect message body type.
  + If it's a pure text, you should leave it as <<-text->>
  + If it's an HTML body, you should set it to <<-html->>
- The second line of this file would be considered as subject.
  Subject could have {target_name} and/or {sender_name} placeholders
  to be replaced at runtime.
- The rest of the file would be considered as message body.
  Message body could also have {target_name} and/or {sender_name} placeholders
  to be replaced at runtime.

**NOTE**
if you haven't provided `sender_name` in `senders.txt` file, you should not
provide {sender_name} placeholder in this file too, otherwise an error would
be raised.

Have a nice day
